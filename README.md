# Block 'em
Block 'em is a lightweight Minecraft "clone" which uses the Lightweight Java Game Library.

##Running the Project
Block 'em can be ran in two ways:

1. Download the project and load it with Netbeans IDE. Fix the dependency issues (lwjgl and slickutil)
2. Download dist.zip
 
##Running the jar
1. Download dist.zip.
2. Extract the file to the location of your choosing. Open CMD (bash if running Linux) and navigate to the directory you extracted to. 
3. Open the "Running the Dist" text file and copy the last line into your terminal (java -Djava.library.path=.\lwjgl-2.9.2\lwjgl-2.9.2\native\windows -jar final-project.jar). If you are using Linux, exchange the backslashes for forward slashes.
4. Execute the line.

##Navigating Block 'em
Navigation around the Block 'em world is possible using the W/A/S/D keys, Up/Down/Left/Right arrows, and the mouse. To regenerate terrain, press F5.
